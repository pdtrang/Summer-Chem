# SIF generator
There are two approaches to generate PDB:

• Directly from probe file.

• Similar to RINerator (http://rinalyzer.de/rinerator.php): use both PDB and proble file to select atom by Biopython function named getAtom(), using its alternative location.

Both approaches has differences compare to Sif file generated by RINerator.

• Interaction types is sorted by order: mc, sc, ligand, solvent; interaction types in RINerator Sif file are mixed.

• Redundant interactions are removed.

Example: Redundant interactions are
```
A:6:_:PRO cnt:sc solvent A:1017:_:HOH
A:6:_:PRO cnt:solvent sc A:1017:_:HOH
A:1017:_:HOH cnt:sc solvent A:6:_:PRO
A:1017:_:HOH cnt:solvent sc A:6:_:PRO
```
In our Sif file, only one interaction is kept; depends on which interaction is processed first from probe file.

## SIF generator from probe file probe2Sif.py
This script takes a probe file as an input and generates SIF file.

>Input: probe file
>Require: res mcatoms dic.py should be placed in the same directory with probe2Sif.py
>Output: Sif file

Example: 
```
./probe2Sif.py 1pwc_h.probe
```

## SIF generator from pdb and probe
This approach reused part of source code from RINerator in trimming Probe. There are two steps required: trim probe and generate Sif file from probe.

Similar to RINerator, all input file locations must be specified in a job script.

Input: similar input as RINerator program. Inputs are specified inside job script.

Output: a new trimmed probe.

Example: 
```
./3bwm_job.py
```
