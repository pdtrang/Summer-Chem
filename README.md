# Summer-Chem

## Requirement

1. Python 2.7
2. Libraries: Biopython 1.69, matplotlib 2.0.2.

For simplicity, use Anaconda to install required libraries.

These scripts here are working with several file formats: 

- Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format: provides a standard representation for macromolecular structure data derived from X-ray diffraction and NMR studies. Proteins of interest can be downloaded at [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). [PDB Contents Guide](ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/doc/format_descriptions/Format_v33_Letter.pdf)
- probe file format: is generated by [Probe software](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/probe.php) 
- Simple interaction format (SIF) file format: is used for building a graph from a list of interactions. Lines in SIF file specify a source node, a relationship type (or edge type), and one or more target nodes. (Reference: [SIF file format - Cytoscape wiki](http://wiki.cytoscape.org/Cytoscape_User_Manual/Network_Formats))
